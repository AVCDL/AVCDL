# AVCDL

## Overview

The **AVCDL** is a set of identified processes, requirements of those processes, generated products,
and mappings from the generated products to their corresponding certification standard (**ISO/SAE 21434**,
**UNECE WP.29 R155-7**) work products: for the purpose of ensuring the creation of secure systems.

## Where to Start

There's a lot of material here with more on the way. The recommended starting point is the [**AVCDL** primary document](./distribution/AVCDL.pdf). The primary document is about 160 pages, so it's recommended that you download or clone the repository. Although you could just download the primary document itself, there are outbound links to the secondary documents that are path relative. If you can get by with just picking things out yourself, then download the primary document, the [secondary documents directory](./distribution/reference_documents/secondary_documents), and the [working material directory](./distribution/reference_documents/working_material).

If you're just interested in the final product, use the [**distribution** sub-tree](./distribution). If you're interested in working on / with the source material, use the [**source** sub-tree](./source).

## Note for Windows Users

If you attempt to clone this repository on a Windows machine, you may run up against the 260 character fully-qualified path name limit. You can enable long FQPNs by following the instructions provided [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=cmd).

## Background Material

The **AVCDL** is backed by a lot of preceding work. You can see a summary [here](./background_material/reference%20material.md).

## Introductory Material

We've written a series of blog posts to introduce the concepts motivating the **AVCDL**. You can find them [here](./background_material/blog_posts/README.md).

## Elaboratory Material

We've written a set of documents that elaborate on the **AVCDL**, its implementation and related topics. You can find them [here](./distribution/reference_documents/elaboration_documents).

## Certification Material

There is documentation relating to the use of the **AVCDL** in the context of ISO 21434, ISO 26262, and UNECE WP.29 certification. You can find them [here](./distribution/reference_documents/certification_documents).

## Release Timetable

The **AVCDL** has a lot of moving parts. We'll be providing material as soon as it has been reviewed by the certification body we're working with. You can see a summary of the secondary document status [here](./document%20status.md).
