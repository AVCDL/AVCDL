# AVCDL

## Overview

The **AVCDL** is a set of identified processes, requirements of those processes, generated products,
and mappings from the generated products to their corresponding certification standard (**ISO/SAE 21434**,
**UNECE WP.29 R155-7**) work products: for the purpose of ensuring the creation of secure systems.

## Where to Start

There's a lot of material here with more on the way. The recommended starting point is the [**AVCDL** primary document](./distribution/AVCDL.pdf). The primary document is about 160 pages, so it's recommended that you download the repository. Although you could just download the primary document itself, there are outbound links to the secondary documents that are path relative. If you can get by with just picking things out yourself, then download the primary document, the [secondary documents directory](./distribution/reference_documents/secondary_documents), and the [working material directory](./distribution/reference_documents/working_material).

If you're just interested in the final product, use the [**distribution** sub-tree](./distribution). If you're interested in working on / with the source material, use the [**source** sub-tree](./source).

## Background Material

The **AVCDL** is backed by a lot of preceding work. You can see a summary [here](./background_material/background%20material.md).

## Introductory Material

We've written a series of blog posts to introduce the concepts motivating the **AVCDL**. You can find them [here](./background_material/blog_posts/README.md).

## Element Relationships

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the various sources for and elements of the **AVCDL**.

## Release Timetable

The **AVCDL** has a lot of moving parts. We'll be providing material as soon as it has been reviewed by the certification body we're working with. You can see a summary of the secondary document status [here](./document%20status.md).
