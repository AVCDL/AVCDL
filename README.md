# AVCDL

## Overview

The **AVCDL** is a set of identified processes, requirements of those processes, generated products,
and mappings from the generated products to their corresponding certification standard (**ISO/SAE 21434**,
**UNECE WP.29**) work products: for the purpose of ensuring the creation of secure systems.

## Where to Start

There's a lot of material here with more on the way. The recommended starting point is the [**AVCDL** primary document](./distribution/AVCDL.pdf). The primary document is about 160 pages, so it's recommended that you download the repository. Although you could just download the primary document itself, there are outbound links to the secondary documents that are path relative. If you can get by with just picking things out yourself, then download the primary document, the [secondary documents directory](./distribution/reference_documents/secondary_documents), and the [working material directory](./distribution/reference_documents/working_material).

## Background Material

Before beginning, you should read the blog series introducing the **AVCDL** and the concepts behind it.

## Release Timetable

The **AVCDL** has a lot of moving parts. We'll be providing material as soon as it has been reviewed by the certification body we're working with. You can see a summary of the secondary document status [here](./document%20status.md).
