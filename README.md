# AVCDL (A Versatile Cybersecurity Development Lifecycle)

## Overview

The **AVCDL** is a set of identified processes, requirements of those processes, generated products, and mappings from the generated products to their corresponding technical standard and regulatory (**ISO/SAE 21434**, **ISO 24089**, **UN R155/6**) work products: for the purpose of ensuring the creation of secure systems. It has been assessed by a leading certification body (see **AVCDL Assessments** below).

## Where to Start (all)

There's a lot of material here with more on the way. The recommended starting point is the [**AVCDL** primary document](./distribution/AVCDL.pdf). Between the primary and roughly 100 supporting documents, the **AVCDL** is over 950 pages, so it's recommended that you download or clone the repository. Although you could just download the primary document itself, there are outbound links to the secondary documents that are path relative. If you can get by with just picking things out yourself, then download the primary document, the [secondary documents directory](./distribution/reference_documents/secondary_documents), and the [working material directory](./distribution/reference_documents/working_material).

There's a video overview of the **AVCDL** available [here](https://youtu.be/AQiNcstp5bM).

If you're just interested in the final product, use the [**distribution** sub-tree](./distribution). If you're interested in working on / with the source material, use the [**source** sub-tree](./source).

The AVCDL document workflow is described [here](./distribution/reference_documents/elaboration_documents/AVCDL%20Documentation%20Management.pdf).

## Where to Start (suppliers)

The **AVCDL** has specific material that addressing supply chain issues.

The recommended starting point for suppliers is this [page](./supply%20chain.md). It summarizes the documents, templates and links specific to suppliers.

## Note for non-Git Users

 If you'd like to download the repository, but aren't a Git user, you can download a ZIP archive. Instructions are provided [here](./zip_downloading.md).
 
 ## Note for Windows Users

If you attempt to clone this repository on a Windows machine, you may run up against the 260 character fully-qualified path name limit. You can enable long FQPNs by following the instructions provided [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=cmd).

## Reference Material

The **AVCDL** is backed by a lot of preceding work. You can see a summary [here](./background_material/reference_material.md).

## Introductory Material

We've written a series of blog posts to introduce the concepts motivating the **AVCDL**. You can find them [here](./background_material/blog_posts/README.md).

## Elaboratory Material

We've written a set of documents that elaborate on the **AVCDL**, its implementation and related topics. You can find them [here](./distribution/reference_documents/elaboration_documents).

## Certification Material

There is documentation relating to the use of the **AVCDL** in the context of **ISO/SAE 21434**, **ISO 26262**, and **UNECE WP.29** certification. You can find them [here](./distribution/reference_documents/certification_documents).

## Training Material

Companion video training material is under active development.

Videos are on the [**AVCDL** YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@AVCDL).

## AVCDL Assessments

The **AVCDL** has been assessed as [complying](./assessments/ISO%20SAE%2021434%202021/TUVSUD_CybersecurityAssessmentSummary_Motional_AVCDL_v.2.12_signed.pdf) to **ISO/SAE 21434**.

The **AVCDL** has been assessed as [complying](./assessments/UNECE%20WP.29%20R155/TUVSUD_CybersecurityAssessmentSummary_R155_Motional_AVCDL_v.3.2.pdf) to **UN R155**.

You can find results of these assessments [here](./assessments).
