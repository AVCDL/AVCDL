## Short Version

The AVCMDS is intended to get a snapshot of the capabilities of the supplier. This is followed by a CMM self-reported from the supplier which is used to determine what their process maturity (aligned with the **AVCDL**) is. The CIA is the legal document used to identify who is responsible for each of the various cybersecurity activities defined in the **AVCDL**. Finally, the CIA summary template is provided to allow for a management-friendly roll-up of the CMM and CIA information.
