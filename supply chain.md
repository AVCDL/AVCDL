# Supply Chain Material

## Overview

Cybersecurity within the supply chain is critical to the cybersecurity of the overall product. This page provides links to the supplier chain-specific **AVCDL** documentation.

## Supplier-related Training Videos

A set of training videos complementing the written AVCDL supply chain documents. A list of the available videos can be found [here](./training#supply-chain).

## Guidance Documents

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the various supply chain-related documents within the **AVCDL**.

The following are some general supply chain-related materials.

### Supply Chain Overview

This is an overview of how supply chain cybersecurity is addressed within the **AVCDL**.

## Supplier Selection Documents

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the various supplier selection-related documents within the **AVCDL**.

Note that the diagram is broken into three phases:

- request for information (RFI)
- request for quote (RFQ)
- development / production / post-production

The following sections address the two phases specific to supplier selection.

### Request For Information (RFI)

During the RFI phase, the supplier is asked to provide information used to determine their cybersecurity maturity and implemented processes.

#### Supplier Cybersecurity Disclosure Statement (AVCMDS)

This material covers how to complete the supplier cybersecurity manufacturer disclosure statement.

### Request For Quote (RFQ)

During the RFQ phase, the supplier and customer establish the responsibilities in the creation, deployment, operation, and decommissioning of the product the supplier provides.

#### Cybersecurity Interface Agreement (CIA)
